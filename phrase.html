        <h1 class="display-4">Phrase</h1>
        <p class="lead">A phrase, according to the Oxford Learner’s Dictionary, is defined as “a group of words without
          a finite verb, especially one that forms part of a sentence.” <br> According to the Cambridge Dictionary, a
          phrase
          is defined as “a group of words that is part of, rather than the whole of a sentence.”<br> The Collins
          Dictionary
          defines a phrase as “a short group of words that people often use as a way of saying something. The meaning of
          a phrase is often not obvious from the meaning of the individual words in it.” It is also defined as “a small
          group of words which forms a unit, either on its own or within a sentence.”
          <br> <br>
          Types of Phrases: <br>
          1. Noun phrase <br>
          2. Adjective phrase <br>
          3. Adverb phrase <br>
          4. Verb phrase <br>
          5. Prepositional phrase
        </p>

        <h3> 1. Noun phrase</h3>
        <p>A noun phrase is a group of words that have a noun or pronoun. It is used to modify the noun. In other words,
          it can be said that a noun phrase can function as a subject, an object or a complement in a sentence.
          <br>
          For example: <br><br>

          - My brother’s friend had come to visit him. (Used as a subject) <br>
          - Scented candles are my favourite. (Used as a subject) <br>
          - The students were asked to find the buried treasure. (Used as an object)
        </p>

        <h3> 2. Adjective phrase</h3>
        <p>An adjective phrase or an adjectival phrase is a group of words that consists of an adjective. It can be used
          to complement it. It provides more information about the noun or pronoun in a sentence. In other words, it can
          be said that it functions just like an adjective in a sentence.
          <br>
          For example:
          <br>
          <br>
          - Annu has silky, smooth hair. <br>
          - People, living in large cities, often find it difficult to reach in time. <br>
          - The team that made it to the final was congratulated in front of the whole school.
        </p>

        <h3> 3. Adverb phrase</h3>
        <p>An adverb phrase or an adverbial phrase is a group of words that includes an adverb and other modifiers. It
          performs all the functions of an adverb. It can be placed in any part of the sentence, with respect to the
          part of speech they modify. <br>

          For example: <br>
          <br>
          - We are planning to finish our group project by the end of May. <br>
          - Later this evening, my cousins and I have planned to go to the park. <br>
          - They saw some abandoned puppies at the corner of the street.
        </p>

        <h3>4. Verb phrase </h3>
        <p>verb phrase can be used just like a verb. It consists of a main verb and an auxiliary verb.
          <br>
          For example: <br> <br>

          - Students are practising hard in order to participate in the state tournament. <br>
          - Aaron has been writing multiplication tables for three hours. <br>
          - The dogs have been barking continuously. <br>
        </p>

        <h3> 5. Prepositional phrase </h3>
        <p>A prepositional phrase consists of a preposition and an object. It works just like an adjective or an adverb.
          It relates the subject and the verb in a sentence. It is used to modify the nouns and verbs in a particular
          sentence.
          <br>
          For example: <br> <br>

          - It was too hard for me to concentrate with the kids jumping around. <br>
          - The jewellery boxes were kept inside the cupboard. <br>
          - On the way to New York, we caught sight of the famous Niagara falls.
