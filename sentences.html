        <h1 class="display-4">Sentences</h1>
        <p class="lead">A sentence is generally defined as words, or a group of words grammatically arranged to make
          grammatical sense. A sentence either expresses an assertion, an affirmation, a question, or a remark. A
          Sentence always follows a common structure to be grammatically sound. It is necessary for a sentence to have a
          subject, a verb, and an object.
        </p>
        <br>

        <h2>Types of English Grammar Sentence</h2>
        <p>Types of English Grammar Sentence
          Based on their structure, Sentences are of the following three types </p> <br>

        <h3>1. Simple Sentences </h3>
        <p> A simple sentence contains a subject and a verb. It expresses a single complete thought that can stand on
          its own.</p>
        <p> Example: The baby cried for food. <br>

          It contains a subject and a verb that expresses a complete thought. <br>
          Example: Professor Maple’s intelligent students completed and turned in their homework. <br>

          A simple sentence does not necessarily have to be short. It can have adjectives. In this case, there are two
          verbs, completed and turned in. However, the sentence expresses one complete thought and therefore is a simple
          sentence.
          Example: Megan and Ron ate too much and felt sick.</p>


        <h3>2. Compound Sentences</h3>
        <p> A compound sentence has two independent clauses. An independent clause is a part of a sentence that can
          stand
          alone because it contains a subject and a verb and expresses a complete thought. <br>
          Basically, a compound contains two simple sentences. <br> <br>
          These independent clauses are joined by a conjunction (for, and, nor, but, or, yet, so). <br>
          Example: They spoke to him in Spanish, but he responded in English.</p>

        <p> This is also a compound sentence that uses a conjunction to separate two individual clauses. <br>
          Example: The shoplifter had stolen clothes, so he ran once he saw the police. <br></p>

        <p> Both sides of the conjunction are complete sentences. <br> ‘The shoplifter had stolen clothes’ can stand
          alone and so
          can ‘he ran once he saw the police. <br> ’ Therefore, this is a compound sentence. <br>

        <h3> 3. Complex Sentences </h3>
        <p> A complex sentence is an independent clause joined by one or more dependent clauses. A dependent clause
          either
          lacks a subject or a verb or has both a subject and a verb that does not express a complete thought. <br>
          A complex sentence always has a subordinator (as, because, since, after, although, when) or relative pronouns
          (who, that, which). <br>
          Example: After eating lunch at The Cheesecake Factory, Tim went to the gym to exercise.
          <br>
          The independent clause is ‘Tim went to the gym to exercise.’ The subordinating clause before it is dependent
          on
          the main independent clause. If one were to say ‘after eating lunch at The Cheesecake Factory’, it would be an
          incomplete thought. <br>
          Example: Opinionated women are given disadvantages in societies that privilege male accomplishments.
          <br>
          The subject is ‘opinionated women’ and the verb is ‘are given’.The first part of the sentence ‘opinionated
          women
          are given disadvantages in societies’ is an independent clause that expresses a complete thought. The
          following
          ‘that privilege male accomplishments’ is a relative clause that describes which types of societies.

          <br>
          Example: The woman who taught Art History 210 was fired for stealing school supplies.
          <br>
          The dependent clause in this sentence is “who taught Art History 210” because if removed, the rest of the
          sentence would stand as an independent clause. “Who taught Art History 210” is an adjective clause that
          provides
          necessary details about the subject, woman.
        </p>
        <h3>4. Compound-Complex Sentence</h3>
        <p> A compound-complex sentence has two independent clauses and at least one dependent clause. <br>
          Example: The two soccer players lost their game, joined their other teammates for lunch, and they went to the
          movies.
          <br>
          If we remove the dependent clause “after the two soccer players lost their game,” we have a compound sentence.
          The dependent clause makes this sentence compound-complex.
