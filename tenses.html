        <h3>3 Future Tenses</h3>
        <p> Time and tide wait for no man. So, a period of time following the moment of
          speaking or writing is called as future tense. <br>
          For e.g- She will write a letter.</p> <br>
        <h4>a simple future</h4>
        <p>This tense tells us about an action which has not occurred yet and will occur after
          saying or in future.</p>

        <p>Positive / Affirmative Sentences –
          Subject + Will/Shall + Verb (Ist form) + Object + (.) <br>
          Example– She will write a letter. <br>
          Negative Sentences-
          Subject + Will/Shall + Not + Verb (Ist form) + Object + (.) <br>
          Example– She will not write a letter. <br>
          Interrogative Sentences- Will/Shall + Subject + Verb (Ist form) + Object + (?) <br>
          Example– Will she write a letter? <br>
          Interrogative Negative Sentences- Will/Shall + Subject + Not + Verb (Ist form) + Object + (?) <br>
          Example– Will she not write a letter
        </p>

        <br>
        <h4>b Future continuous</h4>
        <p>It is used to express an ongoing or continued action in future. <br>
          e.g. He will be distributing sweets in temple tomorrow at 12 o'clock.</p> <br>

        <p>Positive / Affirmative Sentences –
          Subject + Will/Shall + Be + Verb (Ist form) + Ing + Object + (.) <br>
          Example– She will be writing a letter. <br>
          Negative Sentences - Subject + Will/Shall + Not + Be + Verb (Ist form) + Ing + Object + (.) <br>
          Example– She will not be writing a letter. <br>
          Interrogative Sentences- Will/Shall + Subject + Be + Verb (Ist form) + Ing + Object + (?) <br>
          Example– Will she be writing a letter? <br>
          Interrogative Negative Sentences- Will/Shall + Subject + Not + Be + Verb (Ist form) + Ing + Object + (?) <br>
          Example– Will she not be writing a letter?
          <br>
        </p>
        <br>

        <h4>c Future Perfect</h4>
        <p> It is used to express an action which will happen/occur in future and will be
          completed by a certain time in future. <br>
          We use the future perfect to say that something will be finished by a particular time
          in the future. <br>
          e.g. They will have shifted the house by Sunday morning. .</p>

        <p>Positive / Affirmative Sentences –
          Subject + Will/Shall + Have + Verb (3rd form) + Object + (.) <br>
          Example– She will have written a letter. <br>
          Negative Sentences- Subject + Will/Shall + Not + Have + Verb (3rd form) + Object + (.) <br>
          Example– She will not have written a letter. <br>
          Interrogative Sentences- Will/Shall + Subject + Have + Verb (3rd form) + Object + (?) <br>
          Example– Will she have written a letter?
          Interrogative Negative Sentences- Will/Shall + Subject + Not + Have + Verb (3rd form) + Object + (?) <br>
          Example– Will she not have written a letter?

        </p> <br>

        <h4>d Past Perfect Continuous</h4>
        <p>It is used to talk about actions that will commence at a fix time in future and will
          continue for some time in future. <br>
          If there is no time reference, then it is not a Future perfect continuous tense.
          Without continued time reference, such sentences are Future Continuous Tense.
          Continued time reference only differentiates between Future Continuous Tense and
          Future Perfect Continuous Tense. <br>
          The future perfect progressive emphasize the duration of an activity that will be
          in progress before another time or event in the future. <br>
          e.g. This time tomorrow, I will be enjoying the cricket match in the stadium.
